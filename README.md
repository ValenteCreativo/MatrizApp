# MatrizApp

Matriz is a shared infrastructure for independent workers.

 HEAD
Instead of creating their own organizational structure, we invite freelancers to join forces, to share the services and tools we all need to do our jobs.

We seek to connect freelancers, entrepreneurs and collectives who are dedicated to generate positive social and environmental change in the world, interested in improving their quality of work life and increasing the impact of their work through collaboration.
